<h1>Quotes from<br><span style="color:#9CA6B6">Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think</span></h1>

<h3>Chapter Three</h3>

<div class="quotes">
  <p>These [web design] conventions didn’t just come out of thin air: They all started life as somebody’s bright idea. If an idea works well enough, other sites imitate it and eventually enough people have seen it in enough places that it needs no explanation.</p>
  <p>CLARITY TRUMPS CONSISTENCY</p>
  <p>Innovate when you know you have a better idea, but take advantage of conventions when you don’t.</p>
  <p>It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.</p>
