    <p class="uppercase"> <i class="fas fa-paper-plane"></i> &nbsp; Thoughts</p>
    <p>The subtitle of this book ("A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability") is exceedingly accurate. The book is filled with common senseâ€“to the point where I didn't get a whole lot out of it. However, I did appreciate seeing some of my nonverbal understanding of basic usability tenets written out in clear, plain language. </p>
    <p>Krug's book has three main themes: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The importance of information architecture in web & mobile usability</li>
      <li>Usability in a corporate setting, where the team doesn't necessarily buy into the concept</li>
      <li>The basics of conducting usability testing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I found the book most useful in learning the basics of usability testing. Krug says that "the purpose of this kind of testing isn't to prove anything", it's to come up with actionable issues to be solved or at least tweaked. He suggests organizing issues into critical usability problems and low-hanging fruit, because "You can find more problems in half a day than you can fix in a month". For this type of testing, it's not extremely important to target test subjects based on hyper-specialized marketing personas; the most critical usability problems can be discovered by almost anyone. </p>

    <p>Krug has a nice <a href="http://sensible.com/downloads/test-script-web.pdf" target="_blank">boilerplate script</a> for conducting usability testing. His testing method centers around giving the user a series of tasks to complete while they reason out loud, and suggests that "you can get more revealing results if you allow the participant to choose some of the details of the task", because it gives them an opportunity to be more personally involved.</p>
