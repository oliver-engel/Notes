    <p class="uppercase"> <i class="fas fa-paper-plane"></i> &nbsp; Thoughts</p>
    <p>The subtitle of this book ("A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability") is exceedingly accurate. The book is filled with common sense–to the point where I didn't get a whole lot out of it. However, I did appreciate seeing some of my nonverbal understanding of basic usability tenets written out in clear, plain language. </p>
    <p>Krug's book has three main themes: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The importance of information architecture in web & mobile usability</li>
      <li>Usability in a corporate setting, where the team doesn't necessarily buy into the concept</li>
      <li>The basics of conducting usability testing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I found the book most useful in learning the basics of usability testing. Krug says that "the purpose of this kind of testing isn't to prove anything", it's to come up with actionable issues to be solved or at least tweaked. He suggests organizing issues into critical usability problems and low-hanging fruit, because "You can find more problems in half a day than you can fix in a month". For this type of testing, it's not extremely important to target test subjects based on hyper-specialized marketing personas; the most critical usability problems can be discovered by almost anyone. </p>

    <p>Krug has a nice <a href="http://sensible.com/downloads/test-script-web.pdf" target="_blank">boilerplate script</a> for conducting usability testing. His testing method centers around giving the user a series of tasks to complete while they reason out loud, and suggests that "you can get more revealing results if you allow the participant to choose some of the details of the task", because it gives them an opportunity to be more personally involved.</p>

    <blockquote>Innovate when you know you have a better idea, but <strong>take advantage of conventions</strong> when you don’t.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In general, I think it’s safe to say that users don’t mind a lot of clicks as long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they’re on the right track—following what’s often called the “scent of information.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote><strong>Omit needless words</strong>. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>As individuals, we love pages with main menus across the top and submenus down the left side because they’re familiar and easy to use, or we hate them because they’re so boring. We really enjoy using sites with ____, or we find ____ to be a royal pain. And when we’re working on a Web team, it's hard to check those feelings at the door.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>All web users are unique and all web use is basically idiosyncratic.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The problem is there are no simple “right” answers for most Web design questions (at least not for the important ones). What works is good, integrated design that fills a need—carefully thought out, well executed, and tested.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You don’t need to find all of the problems. In fact, you’ll never find all of the problems in anything you test. And it wouldn’t help if you did, because of this fact: You can find more problems in half a day than you can fix in a month.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>After you’ve worked on a site for even a few weeks, you can’t see it freshly anymore. You know too much.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Most people assume that testing needs to be a big deal. But if you make it into a big deal, you won’t do it early enough or often enough to get the most out of it</blockquote>
    <blockquote><strong>Usability:</strong> a person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing [i.e., it’s learnable] to accomplish something [ it's effective] without it being more trouble than it’s worth [ it's efficient].</blockquote>
    <blockquote>One way to look at design—any kind of design—is that it’s essentially about constraints (things you have to do and things you can’t do) and tradeoffs (the less-than-ideal choices you make to live within the constraints).</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Know the main things that people want to do on your site and make them obvious and easy.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Making sites more usable for “the rest of us” is one of the most effective ways to make them more effective for people with disabilities.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>UX sees its role as taking the users’ needs into account at every stage of the product life cycle, from the time they see an ad on TV, through purchasing it and tracking its delivery online, and even returning it to a local branch store.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Almost everything in this book has been about how much the answer to usability questions depends on the context and that the answer to most usability questions is “It depends.”</blockquote>
