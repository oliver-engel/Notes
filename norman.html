    <p class="uppercase"> <i class="fas fa-paper-plane"></i> &nbsp; Fundamental Design Principles</p>
    <p>Looking for practical design theory 101? Norman's book is exactly that–taking great care in accessibly explaining important concepts in psychology and then directly relating them to design. Though there are times he seems to be huffing the fumes of his own genius, the book is nevertheless an enjoyable, enriching read. Like all great design literature I've read, the topics covered here can't be unread–from now on I have a new perspective and set of concepts that will undoubtedly improve my design skills. Let's jump right into a summary, of sorts.</p>

    <p><strong>Characteristics of good design</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><mark>Discoverability</mark>: is it possible for the user to figure out what actions they can take and where they should be performed?</li>
      <li><mark>Understanding</mark>: how should the product be used, and what does it all mean? Can the user understand all the different controls and settings?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Affordances &amp; signifiers</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <mark>affordance</mark> is essentially a relationship between the capabilities of a user and the properties of a physical object that determines how the object could be used (a chair <em>affords</em> sitting). An affordance does not have to be visible, though usability is increased when they are. If invisible, they must be signaled by the presence of a <em>signifier.</em></li>
      <li>A <mark>signifier</mark> is a visible marker that signals <em>where</em> an action can take place. This can be any perceivable mark or sound that communicates an appropriate behavior to the user.</li>
      <li>“Affordances deterine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place.”</li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>Mapping, feedback, models, constraints</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><mark>Mapping</mark> refers to the relationship between the elements of two sets of things, like the mapping of a lightswitch to the light itself. This has importat implications for usability; this is how the user interfaces with the product and learns how its different functions affect the outcome. <mark>Natural mapping</mark> is when the mapping takes advantage of spacial analogies. This leads to immediate understanding, like if a lever, if pushed upwards, moves the object upwards.
      <ul>
        <li>Best mapping: controls are mounted directly on the item to be controlled.</li>
        <li>Second-best mapping: controls are as clsoe as possible to the object to be controlled.</li>
        <li>Third-best mapping: controls are arranged in the same spacial configuration as the objects to be controlled.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
      <li><mark>Feedback</mark> is when the results of an action are communicated back to the user. Feedback must be immediate; too slow of a reaction and the user becomes uncomfortable and no longer in control of the product. But there is a balance; too much feedback will equally annoy the user.</li>
      <li><mark>Feedforward</mark> aids in the process of action execution, so you know <em>what you can do.</em> This is accompished through the use of <em>signifiers, constraints, and mappings</em>.</li>
      <li><mark>Conceptual models</mark> are the explanations of how a thing works. These are generally understood in highly simplified versions that don't necessarily reflect reality, as long as they help the user. When a good conceptual model doesn't exist, "we operate by rote, blindly; we do operations as we were told to do them; we can't fully appreciate why, what effects to expect, or what to do if things go wrong." Conceptual models are especially important when the user encounters a novel situation or when things go wrong. </li>
      <li>There are three different models of any product. There's the designer's model, wherein the creator of the system understands the look, feel, and operation simply because they have created it. The user then has their own model, often different and incomplete from the designer's. And then there is the <mark>system image</mark>, the combined information available (sales literature, guides, etc.), from which the user draws their model.</li>
      <li><mark>Constraints</mark> provide physical, logiacl, semantic, and cultural boundaries which can guide actions and ease interpretations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Actions & perceptions</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>When a person uses something, they face the <mark>Gulf of Execution</mark>, where they try to figure out how the things operates, and the <mark>Gulf of Evaluation</mark>, where they try to figure out what happened. Designers should bridge these two gulfs, <em>using feedback and a good conceptual model</em>.</li>
      <li>There are seven stages of action:
        <br><strong>1.</strong> Goal formation (what do I want to accomplish?)
        <br><strong>2.</strong> Planning the action (what are alternative sequences?)
        <br><strong>3.</strong> Specifying the action sequence (what action can I do now?)
        <br><strong>4.</strong> Performing the action sequence (how do I do it?)
        <br><strong>5.</strong> Perceiving the state of the world (what happened?)
        <br><strong>6.</strong> Interpreting that perception (what does it mean?)
        <br><strong>7.</strong> Comparing the outcome with the original goal (is this ok? Did I accomplish my goal?)</li>
      <li>Designers must consider the three levels of cognitive processing. <mark>Visceral processing</mark> is the most basic, reactive system; for designers, it is about immediate perception. This could be the color palette, sounds, warmth–this is where style matters, and has nothing to do with usability. <mark>Behavioral processing</mark> is the realm of learned skills which are triggered by the situations that match the appropriate patterns. Behavioral processing is mostly subconcious; and for designers, this means that every action should be associated with an expectation (feedback). Finally, <mark>reflective processing</mark> is the home of conscious cognition, where deep understanding develops and decision-making takes place. It's much slower than the other two but is still tightly intertwined with emotion.</li>
      <li>People are naturally storytellers; they look for causes of events to form explanations (this is where a good conceptual model is extremely important to overall understanding). People will tend to assign causality erroneously, especially to things that happen sequentially.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Knowledge &amp; memory</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Knowledge exists both in the head and in the world; behavior results from a combination of these two. We often don't need great precision of this knowledge, just enough to get by. We're further guided by natural constraints in the world and cultural constraints that exist in the head.</li>
      <li><mark>Declarative knowledge</mark> includes knowledge of facts and rules, like that we stop at red lights, and is easy to learn and teach.</li>
      <li><mark>Procedural knowledge</mark> is more difficult to learn, and is best taught through demonstration and learned through practice. This is because the knowledge is largely subconscious.</li>
      <li><mark>Short-term memory (STM)</mark>, or working memory, retains recent experiences and patterns. For practicality in design, assume that STM can only hold 3–5 items at a time.</li>
      <li>STM limitations can be mitigated by engaging multiple senses, such as sight, sound, haptics, spatial locations, and gestures.</li>
      <li><mark>Long-term memory (LTM)</mark> is that of the past; it takes time to get knowledge into and out of it.</li>
      <li><mark>The most effective way of helping people remember is to make it unnecessary to remember; put the required information in the world.</mark></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Techniques in design</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><mark>Task analysis</mark>: a usable design starts with careful observations of how the tasks being supported are actually performed, followed by a design process that results in a good fit to the actual ways the tasks get performed.</li>
      <li><mark>Activity-centered controls</mark>: using switches that control activities (say you're giving a lecture; one activity might be to change the lights to "presentation mode", another might be one that lights the audience for "questions mode").</li>
      <li><mark>Forcing functions</mark>: a form of physical constraint; situations in which the actions are constrained so that failure at one stage prevents the next step from happening.</li>
      <li><mark>Interlocks</mark>: forcing operations to take place in the proper sequence (like a dead man's switch).</li>
      <li><mark>Lock-ins</mark>: keeping an operation active and preventing a person from prematurely stopping it.</li>
      <li><mark>Lock-outs</mark>: preventing someone from entering a space that is dangerous, or preventing a certain event from occurring.</li>
      <li><mark>Activity-centered design</mark> is an approach that focuses on designing for activities, rather than specific people–this works well for large, non-homogenous groups of people. </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Design thinking</strong></p>
    <p><em>"Human-centered design (HCD) is the process of ensuring that people's needs are met, that the resulting product is understandable and usable, that it accomplishes the desired tasks, and that the experience of use is positive and enjoyable. Effective design needs to satisfy a large number of constraints and concerns, including shape and form, cost and efficiency, reliability and effectiveness, understandability and usability, the pleasure of the appearance, the pride of ownership, and the joy of actual use."</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The process of design thinking is split into four components: observation, idea generation, prototyping, and testing. Each is iterated, which each cycle getting closer to the desire solution.</li>
      <li><mark>Observation</mark> is done through design research techniques, like <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/ux-applied-ethnography/" target="_blank">applied ethnography</a>. The basic tenets of user research focus on direct observation of and interaction with the people who will be using the product.</li>
      <li><mark>Idea generation</mark> is the broad process of exploring what's out there–designers should generate as many ideas as possible and also be creative <em>without regard for constraints</em>. </li>
      <li><mark>Prototyping</mark> is the process of mocking-up the product, in various fidelities, mainly to ensure that the design problem is well understood. A popular method is "Wizard of Oz", which can be used to mimic a huge, powerful system long before it can be built. Read more about common practices <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/prototyping-learn-eight-common-methods-and-best-practices" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
      <li><mark>Testing</mark> is also done to ensure that the problem is understood, and then done again in the problem solution phase to test the outcome.</li>
      <li><mark>Iteration</mark> is used for continual refinement and enhancement; here, failure is simply part of the process. "Learning occurs when there are difficulties," says Norman. This is best done in the beginning stages of a product.</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Errors</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><mark>Error</mark> is a general term for all wrong actions; these are further divided into slips and mistakes.</li>
      <li><mark>Slips</mark> occur when a person intends to do one actino and ends up doing something else; there's <mark>action-based slips</mark>, where the wrong action is performed. In <mark>memory-lapse slips</mark>, the intended action is not done.</li>
      <li><mark>Mistakes</mark> occur when the wrong goal is established or the wrong plan is formed. There's <mark>rule-based mistakes</mark>, where the person has appropriately diagnosed the situation, but then decided upon a wrong course of action; the wrong rule is being followed. In <mark>knowledge-based mistakes</mark>, the problem is misdiagnosed because of wrong or incomplete knowledge. <mark>Memory-lapse mistakes</mark> take place when there is forgetting at the stages of goals, plans, or evaluation.</li>
      <li>Most daily errors are slips, and Norman spends a while further breaking these down. Revisit pg. 174 - 188 for more detail.</li>
      <li>Here are Norman's key pieces of advice when designing for errors:
        <ul>
          <li>Understand the causes of error and design to minimize those causes.</li>
          <li>Do sensibility checks. Does the action pass the "common sense" test?</li>
          <li>Make it possible to reverse actions–to "undo" them–or make it harder to do what cannot be reversed.</li>
          <li>Make it easier for people to discover the errors that do occur, and make them easier to correct.</li>
          <li>Don't treat the action as an error; rather, try to help the person complete the action properly. Think of the action as an approximation to what is desired.</li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>


        </ul>
      </li>
      <li></li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Tasks &amp; activities</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <mark>activity</mark> is a high-level structure, like "going shopping". A <mark>task</mark> is a lower-level component of an activity, like "drive to the market". </li>
      <li>"Well-designed devices will package together the various tasks that are required to support an activity, making them work seamlessly with one another, making sure the work done for one does not interfere with the requirements for another."</li>
      <li>Focusing a product solely on tasks is too limiting. Apple's early success with the iPod was largely do the fact that they supported the entire activity of listening to music: the platform, a place to buy music, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>Requirements made in the abstract are invariably wrong. Requirements produced by asking people what they need are invariably wrong. <strong>Requirements are developed by watching people in their natural environment</strong>.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>The design of everyday things is in great danger of becoming the design of superfluous, overloaded, unnecessary things.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is easy to design devices that work well when everthing goes as planned. The hard and necessary part of design is to make things work well even when things do not go as planned.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Science deals in truth, practice deals with approximations.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>When things work, we are informed, comfortable, and effective. When things break, we may no longer be able to function. This dependence upon technology is very old, but every decade, the impact covers more and more activities.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Physical limitations are well understood by designers; mental limitations are greatly misunderstood. We should treat all failures in the same way: find the fundamental causes and redesign the system so that these can no longer lead to problems.</blockquote>
